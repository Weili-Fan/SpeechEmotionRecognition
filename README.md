# SpeechEmotionRecognition

The repository is used for ELEC 301 speech emotion recognition project. 

We tried features of energy, zero-crossing rate, spectrogram and MFCC(Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients).

We used models of SVM (support vector machine), KNN (K nearest neighbors) and CNN (convolutional neural network). 

We achieved the best result of 66.8% accuracy with the combination of MFCC and CNN.
